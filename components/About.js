					All my website designs are made custom for you, your business and your
					brand. I do not use themes, templates or bloated page builders.
				</li>
				<li>
					Iâ€™m a full-stack developer, meaning I am comfortable working with both
					the front end and back end parts of development. This allows me to
					create fully custom and advanced functionality for your website.
				</li>
				<li>
					I specialise in using modern JAMstack tools and headless
					content-management-systems. Sorry for the tech talk - basically, this
					means your website will be fast, more secure and easily scalable.
				</li>
				<li>
					You will be working with a person and not a faceless agency. I will
					regularly keep you updated throughout the project and you will be able
					to contact me directly with any questions or concerns.
				</li>
