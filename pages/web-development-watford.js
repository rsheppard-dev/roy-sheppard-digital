						Benefits of JAMstack development
					</h1>
					<p className='mb-20 text-gray-300'>
						The JAMstack is a modern way of building websites. It takes away the
						need for traditional databases and prebuilds your pages with the
						most up-to-date data, which are then served to visitors of your site
						without making multiple costly server requests. This makes websites
						faster, more secure and easier to scale. It is the perfect choice
						for any size of business.
					</p>

					<ul className='space-y-8'>
						<li>
							<h3 className='font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2'>Speed</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300'>
								JAMstack sites are exceptionally fast as the pages are prebuilt
								and stored on a global CDN. This results in pages loading up to
								10 times faster than conventional sites.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 className='font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2'>Security</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300'>
								No databases or third-party plugins for hackers to target means
								your business and customer data will remain safe and secure.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 className='font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2'>SEO</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300'>
								Having your pages prebuilt means web crawlers can easily explore
								their content. Website performance is a Google ranking factor
								and as JAMstack websites are highly performant this will also
								give your search ranking a boost!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 className='font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2'>
								Scalability
							</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300'>
								JAMstack websites scale as your business grows. Because JAMstack
								sites decouple the visual front end part of the site from the
								technical back end of your site, you can easily add, remove and
								change systems and services without having to overhaul your
								entire website.
